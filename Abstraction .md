# 🐍 Python OOP: Abstract Class & Method Example

## 🎯 AIM

To create an **abstract class** named `Shape` with an **abstract method** `calculate_area`, and implement this method in two subclasses: `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Import ABC module**:
   - Use `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod` to define abstract classes and methods.

2. **Create Abstract Class `Shape`**:
   - Define an abstract method `calculate_area()` with `@abstractmethod`.

3. **Create Subclass `Rectangle`**:
   - Set default values for `length` and `breadth`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the rectangle area.

4. **Create Subclass `Circle`**:
   - Set default value for `radius`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the circle area.

5. **Create Objects & Call Methods**:
   - Instantiate `Rectangle` and `Circle`.
   - Call their `calculate_area()` methods.

## 💻 Program
```
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
class type_shape(ABC): 
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
       pass
class Rectangle(type_shape):
  length = 6
  breadth = 4
  def area(self):
    return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle(type_shape):
    radius = 7
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.radius**2

class Square(type_shape):
    length = 4
    def area(self):
        return self.length**2

class triangle(type_shape):
    length = 5
    width = 4
    def area(self):
        return (self.length*self.width)/2

r = Rectangle() # object created for the class 'Rectangle'
c = Circle() # object created for the class 'Circle'
s = Square() # object created for the class 'Square'
t = triangle() # object created for the class 'triangle'
print("Area of a rectangle:", r.area()) # call to 'area' method defined inside the class.
print("Area of a circle:", c.area()) # call to 'area' method defined inside the class.
print("Area of a square:", s.area()) # call to 'area' method defined inside the class.
print("Area of a triangle:", t.area()) # call to 'area' method defined inside the class.
```

## Result

Thus to create an abstract class named Shape with an abstract method calculate_area, and implement this method in two subclasses: Rectangle and Circle is created and executed successfully.
